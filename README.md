# Homework 7 - CMSC508 - Fall 2023

## Project Overview
This database is designed to support a comprehensive data management system that facilitates the organization and interaction of individuals, their skills, and assigned roles. The primary goal is to efficiently manage and connect these entities, allowing for seamless retrieval and utilization of relevant information. The project involves three main tables: People, Skills, and Roles, each playing a vital role in capturing and organizing essential data within the system.

## Database Schema
The database schema consists of three main tables:

1. People Table
The People table stores individual profiles within the system, capturing details such as first and last names, contact information, professional networking URLs, headshot images, Discord handles, brief biographies, and the date when they joined the system.

2. Skills Table
The Skills table is dedicated to storing information related to various skills, including the skill name, a brief description, a category grouping (tag), a URL associated with the skill, and an estimate of the time required to gain the skill.

3. Roles Table
The Roles table serves as a repository for role-related data, including the role name (e.g., Developer, Boss) and a sort priority that determines the order for sorting roles.

## SQL Queries
To interact with the database, a series of SQL queries have been provided in the documentation. These queries cover a range of tasks, from populating tables to extracting specific information about people, skills, and roles. Refer to the documentation for a detailed list of SQL queries and their applications.

## Files and folders

All necessary files are stored in the *./hw7* folder.

## Getting Started
To set up the database locally, follow these steps:

Create a database using your preferred database management system.
Execute the SQL queries provided in the documentation to create the necessary tables and populate them with sample data.
Use the included SQL queries to interact with and retrieve information from the database.
